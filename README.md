# ![app icon](./.github/readme-images/app-icon.png)Tachiyomi Extensions
Tachiyomi is a free and open source manga reader for Android 6.0 and above.

This repository contains the available extension catalogues for the [Tachiyomi](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi) app.

# Usage

Extension sources can be downloaded, installed, and uninstalled via the main Tachiyomi app. They are installed and uninstalled like regular apps, in `.apk` format.

## Downloads

If you prefer to directly download the APK files, they are available via https://tachiyomi.org/extensions/ or directly in this GitHub repository in the [`repo` branch](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi-extensions/tree/repo/apk).

# Requests

To request a new source or bug fix, [create an issue](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi-extensions/issues/new/choose).

Note that requesting something does not imply that something will be added or fixed in a timely fashion or at all since the work is volunteer-based. Furthermore, some sources may be impossible to do or prohibitively difficult to maintain.

If you would like to see a request fulfilled and have the necessary skills to do so, consider contributing! Issues are up-for-grabs for any developer if there is no assigned user already.

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

Check out the repo's [issue backlog](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi-extensions/issues) for source requests and bug reports.
